        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

        <h2></h2>

            <h4>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
                <p>To have my own consultancy/web dev business providing the services of creating/teaching websites/apps to organisations/iwi-my own and all/indigenous org’s/gov dept’s/start-up’s/ who’s values align with mine - including wellbeing, sustainable seas and environment, rongoa, knowledge of whakapapa and Maori history for all NZer's, education - teaching code in Kura kaupapa, social and economic growth in rural/regional communities.  Low key eco-tourism in Mahia, Ruatorea and Kennedy's Bay. Social enterprise arm for well-being 'hub' in Mahia - including not limited to - a container cafe with a surf club and surf-life saving club (with free wifi), gym, yoga studio/yoga retreats, horticulture, music studio, code camps/tech, creating an environment where you can teach - learn - create employment using these elements.  Utilising the cafe to educate cafe staff, management of the cafe - accounting etc, horticulture - from planting right through the process to creating a business etc, natives, hemp, avo's, citrus, local fishing community for produce, kina research, break up the quota to increase the number of local fisherman to have an equal amount create more employment/training - skippers tickets, etc.</p>  
                <p>Ultimate aim to reduce suicide to zero!!!!  Our community has one of the highest rates of suicide! and I have seen far too many kids, people, mothers, fathers, whanau commit suicide.  I don't know how but creating a safe healthy mind/body/soul environment for them that gives them a purpose or pathway?  Love to create apps/websites to help, create awareness.</p>
                <p>I have seen a lot of kids miss out on opportunites in education/sport, learning tech or code camps due to their circumstances/home for example we have a great facility in Gissy with the mind lab but unfortunately the kids that would benefit the most from it, can't afford it.  These kids have all the potential in the world!, this is why I would love to provide a pathway for them, and give them the tools to know how amazing and treasured they are!</p>

            <h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h4>
                <li>Strengths</li>
                <li>Honest</li>
                <li>Loyal</li>

                <li>Team player</li>
                <li>Great communication skills</li>

            <h4>Limitations</h4>
                <li>Perfectionist - can burnout easily</li>
                <li>Sensitive</li>
                <li>If the task is not a challenge - loose interest fast</li>


            <h4>How I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h4>
                <p>Honesty and Respect - treat other people how you want to be treated.  These are the values I was bought up on.  To have a clear, concise plan of what the objectives are for the team and myself.  I will need to have a break down of my tasks - so I can put into my weekly/monthly calendar - which I can break down into days, then hours - as I have found this to be more effective and efficient for my learning.  I will need to understand what I am doing before I start my tasks, do this by using the problem solving steps, if still unclear I will ask for help to make sure I am on track.  If I come across a problem I can not solve after using the methods above I will ask for help after 25mins.</p>



            <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
                <p>I have experienced the ‘suffer in silence’ in Sprint2 and it was not helpful at all.  I have learnt my lesson and will not waste time on problems I can not solve after 25mins.  I will ask my team, team leader, and/or facilitators for help to achieve the tasks/goals our team has.</p>



            <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
                <p>I am able to ask for help, with a reasonable turnaround.</p>


            <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h4>
                <p>I will have to go back to Mahia for a couple of days to see my children - not sure when that might be yet.</p>  


            <h4>For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h4>
