                Ultimate aim to reduce suicide to zero!!!!  Our community has one of the highest rates of suicide! and I have seen far too many kids, people, mothers, fathers, whanau commit suicide.  I have seen a lot of kids miss out on opportunites in sport, learning tech or code camps due to their circumstances/home for example we have a great facility in Gissy with the mind lab but unfortunately the kids that would benefit the most from it, can't afford it.  These kids have all the potential in the world!, this is why I would love to provide a pathway for them, and give them the tools to know how amazing and treasured they are!

                Learning the Problem Solving skills better
                Knowledge
                Adaptability 


            <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
                Strengths 
                Honest
                Loyal
                Creative
                Determined 
                Trustworthy
                Team player
                Great communication skills

                Limitations
                Perfectionist - can burnout easily 
                Sensitive
                If the task is not a challenge - loose interest fast


            <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
                Honesty and Respect - treat other people how you want to be treated.  These are the values I was bought up on.
                To have a clear, concise plan of what the objectives are for the team and myself.
                I will need to have a break down of my tasks - so I can put into my weekly/monthly calendar - which I can break down into days, then hours - as I have found this to be more effective and efficient for my learning.  
                I will need to understand what I am doing before I start my tasks, I will do this by using the problem solving steps, if still unclear I will ask for help to make sure I am on track.
                If I come across a problem I can not solve after using the methods above I will ask for help after 25mins.



            <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
                I have experienced the ‘suffer in silence’ in Sprint2 and it was not helpful at all.  
                I have learnt my lesson and will not waste time on problems I can not solve after 25mins.
                I will ask my team, team leader, and/or facilitators for help to achieve the tasks/goals our team has.



            <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
                I am able to ask for help, with a reasonable turnaround.



            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
                I will have to go back to Mahia for a couple of days to see my children - not sure when that might be yet.  
                


            <h3>For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h3>

                Matariki x 2019



            <h3>These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.</h3>
