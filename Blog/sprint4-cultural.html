            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
                
            <h4>Discuss how understanding the principals of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>
                
                <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people by changing their mindset to a positive growth mindset, believing in themselves, start to feel empowered that they have the ability to change and adapt new skills.</p>
                 
                <p>When you feel empowered about learning because you believe in yourself and know it’s a scientific fact you can - learning becomes fun and exciting.  You become happier, knowing your working/learning towards a better version of yourself.  You apply yourself more knowing your outcome will be greater.</p>
                
                <p>The idea that intelligence is malleable - increases the chances of people succeeding – because it gives people faith, hope, a positive attitude, self-worth, that becomes contagious and you attract people who are on the same wavelength.</p>
                
                
            <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h4>
                
                <p>Practise the exercise, repeat the exercise, review (myself and others) and reflect,  repeat - with the modified changes and repeat.  Keeping in mind the more I practise the more I grow, creating stronger neural connections. Believing in myself - using these in my daily morning ritual of gratitude and affirmations.  Motivates me to learn and makes my learning experience exciting knowing I can do it through practice, reflect/review.  Neuroplasticity helps cancel out any negative thoughts that come up.</p> 
                
            <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplaticity</h4>
                
                <p>Practise, Practise, Practise.  Review and Reflect and Repeat.  Use relatable experiences to remember new material.  Mental practise is also a way to prepare for a physical skill - that combined with physical practise and effort - will grow the brain, and succeed.</p>

            <h3>GROWTH MINDSET</h3>
                
                <p>“In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.”</p>
                
                <p>All the tiny actions build up to a growth mindset.  I can succeed by applying myself with 100% effort daily, then the more I grow and learn, and become more confident.  Having a growth mindset is relevant because it is about achieving the tiny daily tasks/goals.  Which will then help me achieve graduating as a web developer/life goals.</p>
                
                
            <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
                
                <p>What resonated with me was the gym example - when people come into the gym they are not confident - but tiny actions daily by committing to exercising daily builds up to a growth mindset and you become confident and believe in yourself and can physically see the growth.  I didn’t really know a lot about growth mindset - it was having a positive mindset.  But a growth mindset is powerful.  I guess I didn’t realise the potential I/we have to achieve our goals through having a growth mindset.</p>
                
                
            <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
                
                <p>By knowing and putting in 100% effort everyday, being persistent, I can develop my abilities and talents and achieve my goals of graduating as a web developer, and my personal goals.  Life is a learning journey – I will continue to learn everyday.</p>
