        <h4>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h4>
	
                <p>HTML is the structure of a web page, it contains the content (text) using elements to manipulate the page.  For example some of the elements in HTML you use a to write a paragraph have to be inside the <'p'>This is the start of the paragraph with text</'p'> element for paragraphs, and headings have to be inside the heading element <'h1'>Heading content</'h1'>.  With a couple of other main elements, you have a web page!  If you look at your page it will look a little plain.  To format and style your page you need to use CSS.  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets - it is the tool required for styling the page, e.g. font size, colour, spacing, back ground colour etc.  You use elements in CSS similar to HTML to write your styling, reference the CSS page to HTML, then link HTML to the CSS page.</p>
                
                <p>HTML is similar to how a sheet of music needs structure.  The music sheet needs structure so the composer/musician knows what and where to write each note to create the melody.  The structure of the sheet of music needs The Staff, the Treble Clef, or/and Bass Clef, with each space and line representing a key (sound of music).</p>

                <p>So far you have the sheet of music with no notes or melody.  Similar to how HTML needs CSS to style the page, the composer/musician needs a structured sheet of music to create the melody because each line and space on the Staff is a note that makes a different sound.  The notes also represent the beat.  If the composer just wrote the notes on a plain sheet paper the musician wouldnâ€™t know what note it is, what the melody is, or the beat.  Therefore the composer can create the melody and beat of the song by writing the notes on the music sheet.  Like styling the page of HTML.</p>  
                

        <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h4>
                
                <p>An example for control flow and the loops process is similar to the kids after school routine.</p>

                    <li>Kids After School Routine</li>
                    <li>Unpack bag and lunchbox</li>
                    <li>if true then have something to eat</li>
                    <li>if false get asked to do it</li>
                    <li>then clean up</li>
                    <li>if false no playtime</li>
                    <li>homework</li>
                    <li>if false bed early</li>
                    <li>play</li>


        <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>
                <p>The DOM is a Document Object Model - it is an object representation of the entire HTML document.  It is like the GLUE that ties HTML, CSS, and JS together.  You can manipulate your webpage in the DOM using developer tools - you can see your HTML code, CSS style code, JS and many features.</p>

        <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
                <p>A function is a tool used to group statements together that can be re-useable</p>
