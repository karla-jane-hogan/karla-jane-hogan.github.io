        <h1>IDENTITY AND VALUES</h1>

        <h2>CORE PERSONAL VALUES</h2>
                
            <p>I always believed my core values were honesty, respect, passionate about helping people, I have a purpose to work for the greater good of humanity.  After completing the personality test - I feel my results were extremely accurate.  I have an Advocate personatly type. Inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is that they are not idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to realise their goals and make a lasting positive impact. They tend to see helping others as their purpose in life, but while people with this personality type can be found engaging rescue efforts and doing charity work, their real passion is to get to the heart of the issue so that people need not be rescued at all.</p>
            <p>The advocates traits I resonate with are: though soft-spoken, they have very strong opinions and will fight tirelessly for an idea they believe in. They are decisive and strong-willed, but will rarely use that energy for personal gain – Advocates will act with creativity, imagination, conviction and sensitivity not to create advantage, but to create balance. Egalitarianism and karma are ideas I believe and nothing would help the world so much as using love and compassion.</p>
            <p>Respect for yourself and others - have a talent for warm, sensitive language, speaking in human terms, rather than with pure logic and fact. It makes sense that their friends and colleagues will come to think of them as quiet Extraverted personality types, but they would all do well to remember that Advocates need time alone to decompress and recharge, which is what I enjoy - I do love my own company/space to be.</p>


        <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
             
            <p>My culture has influenced my values and identity with eveything I do because it is who I am, it is in me.  My culture is maori, English, Irish, Scottish, and Portuguese.  Knowing I am direct descent of Porourangi, Te Rakato, and a long line of strong maori women gives me strength/mana within myself, and for my children.  When I go back home to Mahia and Ruatoria - Reporua and Tuparoa a sense of belonging comes over me - I can feel the mauri, as soon as I see my maunga, or hear the waves crashing, or see the milky way I feel at home.  Having this connection with the sea, land, spirit, te ao Maori, universe - has always guided me when I have needed it, positive or negative situation, going home always takes me in the direction I have needed to go in.  This influenced my values my identity and has helped shaped who I am, and where I am now in this present moment.</p>
            
            <p>My nan was the backbone - the pou of our entire whanau (including wider whanau from Mahia), she was very staunch, hard working, and her doors were always open to anyone who needed help - and her kitchen was the heart and soul to our whanau.  This is apart of my culture.  
            Whanau meant everything, caring for people meant everything, being compassionate meant everything, no matter what the circumstance was.  Compassion is one value I learnt from my nan which has more meaning today than it ever did!  This is one example of what I learnt from my nan, what she taught all her mokopuna.  These experiences and lessons from my nan is all part of what makes some of my identity and has influenced my core values of honesty (with yourself first), respect, love, gratitude, happiness, and compassion.</p>

        <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>
                
            <p>My sister and her baby were in a house that was making them sick.  I went to see them, and my nephew was so sick - I took him (with her permission) and he lived with me until she found a healthy, warm home to live in.  Helping my family and others is a core value of mine.  I will do anything to help my family and friends.  They know they can always rely on me no matter the time or place.</p>
    

        <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h4>
            <p> the evidence gathered my personality strengths are loyal, I am creative - a vivid imagination with a strong sense of compassion, and use my creativity to resolve not technical challenges, but human ones.  I enjoy finding the solution for someone I care about, which makes me a good advisor.  I am Insightful - see through dishonesty and disingenuous motives, and like to get to the point to a more honest discussion, and have the insight to get to the heart of the matter.  I am Inspiring and Convincing - I speak with warmth and passion if I am proud of what I am speaking for.  I am Decisive - able to follow through on their ideas with conviction, willpower, and the planning necessary to see complex projects through to the end.  I am Determined and Passionate - when I believe something is important, I will pursue that goal with conviction and energy and altruistic.</p>
        
            <p>My limitations are Sensitive - when questioned about my principles or values.  I am extremely private.  I am a perfectionist.  I can burn out easily - with my passion, poor patience for routine maintenance, tendency to present themselves as an ideal, and extreme privacy, leaves me with little options to wind down, relax.  I need to find a way to balance my ideals with the realities of day-to-day.</p>
            
            
        <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>
            
            <p>I was in a toxic marriage, and the ethical decision I made was to leave him.  The values involved in that decision were:</p> 
                <li>Honesty - being honest with myself and knowing that this relationship wasn’t right - mentally, emotionally and physically.  Being honest          meant I was living a lie, it was drivin from ego and pride.  Being honest and acceptance was liberating, and life is way to short to              appreciate it and live in awareness and in your truth with gratitude, surrounded by whanau and the ones you love and who love you                 unconditionally.</li>
                <li>Whanau - putting my children first, getting them out of that environment for their health - emotionally and mentally.  That was more              important then having them experience an abusive marriage.  I also didn’t want my children to think or believe that this is how women are         treated, or how men should treat women - people should be treated equally, we are all one.</li>
                <li>Respect - if I didn’t have any self respect, how were children supposed to respect themselves, me a mother, and anyone else.</li>
                <li>Self worth and love - once I started to realise I did have self worth, it was easier to leave.</li>
                <li>Gratitude - being grateful I was alive with two beautiful children and whanau to help was grounding.</li>

            <p>The consequences of the action I took by taking my children and leaving him were a sense of freedom - the same weekend I felt I was being pulled back home to Mahia and straight to Tangaroa - jumped in and I knew right then I was leaving and I felt this huge weight lifted off my shoulders, I burst into tears of happiness and I felt I could breath again.  Reconnecting to my roots literally! I felt free to be, be present, aligned, happiness, love, the journey of rediscovering myself and seeing how happy my children were.</p>
            
            
        <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
            
            <p>Through my journey I have become more aware of how important my culture and values are, especially in this present time, along with the many lessons I have learnt.  Knowing I had my whanau, my nan spiritually, and the connection to papatuanuku, tangaroa, marama, te ao maori, gave me the strength to listen and do something to change the circumstances for myself and my kids</p> 
            


        <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
            
            <p>I am creative, with a strong sense of compassion, I can use my creativity to resolve human challenges.  I enjoy finding the solution to the problem which is great as it is a big part of web development.  Because I am insightful, convincing, decisive, determined and passionate about helping people - this would be great for my career development as I can communicate well with our team and clients. Balance - mind, body and soul is also key for my learning and development, to make sure I do not burn myself out.  Also letting go of being a perfectionist - its ok to start and make mistakes, as I will learn and grow from them.</p> 
            
            
        <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>
            
            <p>Being creative with a vivid imagination and strong sense of compassion will help me in my learning journey by being able to resolve human challenges with respect, solving problems, having honest discussions, getting to the heart of the matter.</p>
            
            
        <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h4>
            
            <p>I was project manager for Hui Taumata Trust working on the Communications project - connecting rural nz.  I was in Mahia working with the local Social Services group at the Community Centre and I had to make a video to play during a live stream through the roundtable (10 years ago).  Resistance came when inviting local people to the event in Mahia via email, they didn’t really understand what the event was.  The strategies I used at the time was physically going into their workplaces e.g. the council, gov departments to explain exactly what the project was about, and why.  In rural communities, I found it was a lot more respectful if I organised a meeting with them.  In reflection, when working on projects with other companies, I would organise meetings with them first along with an email, so we are all on the same page.</p>
