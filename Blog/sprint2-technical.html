    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids? <em> </em> </h2>
    
    
    
        <h3>Classes</h3>
            <p>Classes are for when you want to apply this to multiple elements.
            .bold, .italic, .aligncenter, .floatleft are examples of good uses for classes, because you're going to (potentially) want to make multiple items on your page bold, italic, center aligned or floated to the left.

            <p>example: .floatleft {/p>
                    float: left;
                    } </p>          
            <p>So for the example above, that'd obviously float the element to the left, and all you'd need to do is give the element that class:</p>

            <p>example: p class="floatleft">I'm floated left</p>
            <p>example: div class="floatleft">Me too</div></p>
        
        <h3>ID's</h3>
            <p>ID's should be used differently. A good way to explain this is to think about the structure of your webpage. Let's take your header. You are only going to have one header on your page, you're not going to go around telling different elements that they are a header, because there's only one header! Here you use ID.</p>

            <p>#header {
            width: 100%;
            height: 75px;
            background-color: black;
            }
            </p>

            <p>Then, in your HTML:

                <div> example:  div id="header">Header content (close div) </div>
                <div> example:  div id="anotherPageSection" class="floatleft">Content here (close div)</div>
                <div> example:  div id="footer">Footer here (close div)</div>
            </p>
