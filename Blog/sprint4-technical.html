                <p>The scenarz of problem solving for me!</p>

                <p>I was blocked for AGES (and that is a huge understatement)!  So first of all the problem I was blocked on wasn't so much the actual task it was my stubborn ego!  It was minesweeper - a game we have to make and one of the tasks is to add all the counters.  Which is all good - BUT in my head it didn't make sense to copy and paste 100 times - there has to be a function...... right?  Obviously there is - but because I am still learning/kind of forgotten a lot/it feels like I'm learning 5 different languages at the same time/I can't understand most of it, I couldn't find the function, and wasted soooooooo much time on it because I was determined to find one! ANYWAY - FORGOT the entire PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESS, and asked for help after a gigantic piece of time wasted!  It was absolutely ridiculous!  As a result I started doubting myself BIG TIME, I wrote the function, it didn't work, wrote something completely different, and that was on repeat like 10 times over, I was a mess! more time wasted!</p>
                <p>LESSONSSSSSSSSSSSSS LEARNED!  1. FOLLOW THE PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESS! get clear about the problem is! USE THE TOOLS! Pseudocode - I found this very helpful to explain what is happening in the code (in english) and CONSOLE.LOG is awesome! It tells you were the errors are in the DOM so you can navigate to the exact error and go from there!  THESE ARE MY FAVOURITES!  2. AFTER 25MINS ASK FOR HELP - If I have tried everything I can in 25mins and it still isn't working ASK FOR HELP!  Get over my own ego and pride because at the end of the day the only person who is suffering and losing time is me!  I am not doing myself any favours!  ASK FOR HELP!  3. GROWTH MINDSET! - I can do it!  4. MEDITATE! OMG it is AMAZING AND SO HELPFUL!</p>
